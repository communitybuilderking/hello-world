# hello-world
This is the first repository in the community builder artificial intelligence series. 
My name is Travis King and I'm in the process of teaching myself how to Train my first neural network: basic classification using TensorFlow. I'm the host of the Community Builder Podcast, B2B marketing strageist and lifelong student. I'm addicted to learning and enjoy the adventure of a great story. I'm taking a page from one of my favorite people, Tim Ferriss with a twist. My twist. Looking at myself as the main character in my story. By doing that, I've been able to remove all of my emotions from the picture (for the most part) and let the "director" Travis make sure he's living his best life (https://open.spotify.com/track/17jeLyQcEUmKv3MXeEo79k?si=SMyCj0xcQkmlguSR-h9t_w) Not sure how links work in here but there's my mood through this experiement! Also shameless plug, if you know anyone building a cool artificial intelligence community let me know! I'd love to interview for the podcast! Okay, time to go to the next part of the mission :-) --> I feel Like I'm in GTA. Okay, I'm on to the next part for real now...
